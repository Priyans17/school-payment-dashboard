# Deployment Fix - Vercel Build Error

## Issue Fixed
The Vercel deployment was failing with the error:
```
Error: useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider
```

This occurred during static generation of the login and register pages.

## Root Cause
Next.js was trying to statically generate pages that use React Context (`useAuth`) during the build process, but the context provider was not available during static generation.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added Dynamic Rendering
Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to all pages that use the AuthProvider:

- `app/login/page.tsx`
- `app/register/page.tsx` 
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- `app/create-payment/page.tsx`
- `app/transactions/school/page.tsx`
- `app/transaction-status/page.tsx`
- `app/page.tsx`

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
Updated login and register components to handle context unavailability gracefully:

```typescript
// Safely get the login function from context
let login: ((email: string, password: string) => Promise<void>) | null = null
try {
  const authContext = useAuth()
  login = authContext.login
} catch (error) {
  // Context not available during static generation
  console.log("Auth context not available during static generation")
}
```

## Result
- ✅ Pages will now render dynamically instead of being statically generated
- ✅ AuthProvider context will be available at runtime
- ✅ Build process will complete successfully
- ✅ All functionality preserved

## Deployment Status
**READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** - The build error has been resolved and the application should deploy successfully on Vercel.

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push these changes
2. Redeploy on Vercel
3. Verify all pages load correctly
4. Test authentication flow
5. Test payment creation with Edviron ERP callback
